# Huh?

This is the repo for my personal website and blog. I want to use it to write about stuff that interests me - mostly tech. Some topics close to my heart are TypeScript, GraphQL, React (mostly native) and cloud development. Expect to see some posts related to them!

## Who?

My name is Luke. I'm a full-stack software engineer, based in London, UK.

## Where?

You can find the site [here](lukerogerson.me). Please take a look!

## What?

It's a React Gatsby app developed in TypeScript. I like Gatsby due to its speed, simplicity and the fact that it uses GraphQL! It's hosted on AWS S3 and CloudFront.

## Why?

I'm trying to be more pragmatic in everything I do - that includes dev work. This site is by no means finished - someone advised recently that _done is better than perfect_. But I wanted to replace my ageing Wordpress site and have a platform _right now_ to share things I find useful and interesting! So I think it's OK that it isn't _perfect_!

I want to keep improving the site (things like stronger TypeScript types and more content immediately spring to mind!) - both in terms of features and usefulness, as well as for things I want simply to learn, such as CI/CD pipelines, cloud functions and React animation!

Stay tuned!
