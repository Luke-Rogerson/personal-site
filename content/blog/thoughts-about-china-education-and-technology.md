description: Some ponderings about the importance of technology in education, and why China is so different to the West for education
---

For the last four years, I was part of an English-language education organization in southern China. It was a really great experience - I certainly grew a lot both personally and professionally, learnt new skills and just _grew up_ in many different ways!

Teaching, working and living in China is an eye-opening experience. It is a truly fascinating and diverse country - with a lot to both frustrate and fall in love with. The rate of change and development is absolutely staggering, even today.

[According to the World Bank, since 1978, China has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty](http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview#1), a monumental achievement! People sometimes talk about the "American Dream" as something all Americans can aspire towards. Perhaps we should also talk about the Chinese Dream!

Yet, China has some big, deep-rooted problems it needs to tackle in the coming years and decades, even putting aside discussions about its authoritarian government! In rural areas, there is still a lot of poverty. Wealth inequality is massive, as well as regional and gender inequality, and social mobility is non-existent in a lot of places.

Clearly, education has a huge part to play in solving all these problems. As Nelson Mandela said:

![A quote by Nelson Mandela reads: ](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0661/7423/files/inspire-blog-section.jpg?16519069034986191748)

Education is, in my mind, the best way to end this cycle of poverty and inequality. In China, the public school system is not very good (although I'm not sure sometimes how much better British schools are), with way too much emphasis on tests and rote learning. The private education industry is just exploding, growing hugely year-on-year as people get wealthier and parents look around for alternatives to fill the gaps in the public system.

Yet, this investment and growth is all from the private sector (you would never, for example, be able to approach the Chinese government for help and funds to start an American-style [charter school](http://www.uncommonschools.org/our-approach/faq-what-is-charter-school)) and, as you might imagine, a lot of these new schools, weekend classes, art workshops, [lego construction classes](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lego-strategy-china-analysis/lego-builds-foundations-in-china-classrooms-as-old-markets-slow-idUSKCN1G3020), you name it, are of dubious quality and too often all about the profit.

And then there's the bigger issue that, putting aside questions of quality, these kinds of fee-paying, after school, extra classes are usually completely inaccessible to most poorer families and children. It's all well and good for the "rich kids" whose parents can afford to send them to extra Math, English, Chinese, etc classes two or three times a week, but what of those kids whose families can't? In a developing country such as China, they get left behind and miss out on a lot of opportunities.

What can we do about this? Well, we need to make education more accessible and cheaper to everyone. How do I think is the most realistic way we do this? Through technology.

There are so many options for to do this now. Blended learning and the [flipped classroom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) promise more effective learning for students and less work for teachers. Online classes offer a way of delivering education straight into people's homes without the need for a teacher to be physically there, as well as teaching about other cultures and perspectives that are very different from anything a poorer student would experience at home*.* [VR and AR show us how we might explore and learn about the world without leaving the classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQMA5NNhN58). Learning management systems, such as [TalentLMS](https://www.talentlms.com/), offer better ways of assessment. A teacher can for example give out an assignment and then monitor student progress, how much time they are all spending on each question, and whether their answers are correct, and then use this information to decide what topics need more review. It's such an exciting time for [EdTech](http://www.futureoftech.co.uk/education/what-is-edtech)!

I love both technology and education, and I am a big believer in how tech can support, augment and revolutionize learning as we know it. It's a big reason for why I'm now on this journey to become a software developer!
